plot.group,"general plot group name to allow comparison of values for the same plot.group for different veg.age/plot.type (see below); most important for matching soil values to baseline values; in many cases all plots of a study are in the same plot.group (enter any general name for this group), unless there are multiple distinct baseline values or regions under consideration",,,,,,,
plot.name,specific individual plot name (if any) to distinguish between multiple plots within the same plot.group; use names given in figures/tables wherever possible,,,,,,,
plot.type,general characterization of plot type to tag general relationships between samples in the same plot.group,"baseline, reference, mature, NA",,,,,,
,baseline: applies to soil samples only; plot is considered a baseline sample by authors (e.g. adjacent unrestored ag field for soil sample); otherwise youngest plot age <=5 yrs used for comparison to older plots,,,,,,,
,reference: considered a reference sample by authors; i.e. age >> other samples (e.g. from nearby relatively undisturbed riparian vegetation),,,,,,,
,"mature: like reference, but specifically described as ""mature"" or ""remnant"" vegetation by authors; particularly useful when age unknown",,,,,,,
,"NA = all others (not baseline, reference, or mature), except where useful to tag unusual veg types:",,,,,,,
,      poplar plantation = site specifically planted just to grow & harvest poplar,,,,,,,
,"      grazed, invaded, bamboo = notable types of riparian veg that we may want to exclude or examine separately at some point",,,,,,,
woody.veg,is woody veg present? (yes/no),yes; no,,,,,,
veg.planted,was plot planted (yes/no),yes; no,,,,,,
veg.age.yrs,"age in years (if known); if range of years, enter mid-point; if at least XX yrs, give minimum value; if unknown, enter NA",,,,,,,
soil.texture,"any description of soil texture; if only % clay, sand, silt provided, enter description based on NRCS texture triangle; if not given, NA","e.g., sandy loam, silty clay",,,,,,

metric,type of estimate: biomass stock; carbon stock; carbon concentration (for soil only); bulk density (for soil only),biomass stock; carbon stock; carbon concentration; bulk density; organic matter concentration,,,,,,
value,"value for a single plot, or mean value for a single plot type or group of similar plots",,,,,,,
value.se,"if ""value"" field represents a mean, give standard error (if known/provided)",,,,,,,
value.units,"measurement units for ""value"" field","e.g., kg/ha, t/ha, %, g/cm3",,,,,,
value.precision,how were values obtained? e.g. reported mean for plot type (as in a table or text) or data thief Fig. 2 (extracted data from digitized figure),"e.g., reported mean for plot type; data thief Fig. X",,,,,,
comments,"any additional notes, e.g. aboveground biomass values come from summing reported values for trees and shrubs","e.g., trees+shrubs",,,,,,
flag,flag row of data that may be partially duplicated in the same study or another publication from the same study area/data set: ,"1, 2, or 3",,,,,,
,"1 = value for aboveground biomass when inventory biomass also reported, or value for biomass stock when carbon stock also reported (generally will be filtered out)",,,,,,,
,2 = mean values for a group of plots when individual plot values are also available (e.g. table reports means but individual values extracted from figure) (generally will be filtered out),,,,,,,
,3 = soil value for a total depth when individual values for shallower layers also reported (e.g. 0-50cm when 0-25 and 25-50cm also provided) (generally will be filtered out),,,,,,,
